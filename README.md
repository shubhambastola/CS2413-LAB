Reverse a Singly Linked List
This function reverses a singly linked list in C using an iterative approach. It modifies the next pointers of each node to reverse the list in-place.

Algorithm

a) Initialize previous as NULL.

b) Traverse the list while head is not NULL:

c) Store the next node.

d) Reverse the next pointer.

e) Move previous and head forward.

f) Return previous as the new head.

Time Complexity: O(n)
